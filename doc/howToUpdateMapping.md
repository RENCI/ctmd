## Update CTMD mapping

In order to update/add/remove a field, please make changes to the <b>mapping.json</b> file because this is the file that the pipeline uses to build the database. For a much better human-readable form of mapping.json, please refer to <b>CTMD data mapping.csv</b> and remember updating this file with corresponding changes made to mapping.json in order to keep it current.
