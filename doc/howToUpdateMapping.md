## Update CTMD mapping

In order to update/add/remove a field, please make changes to the [mapping.json](https://github.com/RENCI/HEAL-data-mapping/blob/master/mapping.json) file because this is the file that the pipeline uses to build the database. For a much better human-readable form of mapping.json, please refer to [CTMD data mapping.csv](https://github.com/RENCI/HEAL-data-mapping/blob/master/CTMD%20data%20mapping.csv) and remember updating this file with corresponding changes in mapping.json in order to keep it current.
